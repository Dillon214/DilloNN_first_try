# DilloNN_1
Here's a neural network builder/trainer. Unfinished, but currently functional. Currently cannot have multiple output nodes, and the output node it does have must be a linear activation (This goes against the guide I used, but I wanted the network to predict numbers, not categories). Used https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/ as reference for methodology, but all code is original. Tested on iris dataset to good effect.

Recently addec bias and a nice graph of how the error changes across epochs. Also, made Learning Rate decrease alongside the error.
