# DilloNN_1
Here's a neural network builder/trainer. Unfinished, but currently functional. Currently cannot have multiple output nodes, and the output node it does have must be a linear activation (This goes against the guide I used, but I wanted the network to predict numbers, not categories). Used https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/ as reference, but all code is original. 

Version 2 can have multiple output nodes.
